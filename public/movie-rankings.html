            <h3>The Anthropocene Reviewed by John Green</h3>
                <p>Essays ranking aspects of humanity (yes, all of it) on a five-star scale. Equally amusing and heartfelt. Pretty cover design, too. If you've ever wondered what Mario Kart can tell us about how we relate to one another in society, then that can be the first essay you read. Take your time with this collection. Read the essays out of order. Have a good time.</p>
            <h3>Song of Solomon by Toni Morrison</h3>
                <p>This book is about a lot of things, including family legacies. The journey of the protagonist to learn and understand his ancestry can feel like a mystery, but is also unquestionably relatable. I love it so much I have the title tattooed on my arm. Obviously, don't get a tattoo of this book (unless you love it as much as I did).</p>
            <h3>The Kushiel Trilogy by Jacqueline Carey</h3>
                <p>A sweeping epic that crosses dozens of years, multiple countries, and the adventures of a courtesan highly trained in espionage. One of the smartest series I've ever read. Equal parts page-turner, treatise on consent, and exploration of religion in our lives, I highly recommend this series.</p>
